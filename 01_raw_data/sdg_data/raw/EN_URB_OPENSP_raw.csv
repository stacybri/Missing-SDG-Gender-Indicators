Data on street lines is majorly sourced from OpenStreetMap, and street widths are estimated through sampling and measurement from GoogleEarth. City/urban area used in the analyis has been generated using a classification approach based on the Degree of Urbanization concept to city definition  - as a result, the urban/city area used for the indicator computation in this data table may be larger or smaller than the official municipality boundary.
